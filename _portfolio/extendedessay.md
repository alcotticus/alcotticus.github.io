Summary
------
I completed my IB Extended Essay in physics over the course of two years, investigating the relationship between hopper wall inclination angle and the rate of flow of sand through a wedge-shaped hopper. This idea occurred to me while reading about the infamous conveyor belt problem; I had seen videos depicting the sand flow and noticed some discrepancies in flow pattern, leading to my reading up on the different types of flow (mass versus funnel). Another reason for my choice of topic was my excitement for the chance to develop my 3D modelling and printing skills. At this point, I had just started learning how to use Fusion 360 and I was eager for the chance to apply my newly-gained proficiencies.

Process and Reflections
------
Although there already exists extensive literature on the validitity of established equations (such as Beverloo's) in describing flow rate of granular materials, I was unsatisfied with the relevance of these analyses as they were purely based on empirical observations rather than theory. As such, many variables, including my independent variable of hopper geometry, were simply reduced to experimentally-determined constants, and the relationship I wanted to investigate could not be predicted via equation. To solve this issue and form a hypothesis, I adapted some mathematical derivations of mass flow rate to better fit my problem.

Due to limitations in Extended Essay length, I was not able to implement my idea of including simulated results for comparison against real-life experiments. Still, I used LIGGGHTS, an open-source discrete-element method solver for granular materials, to investigate this out of curiosity and obtained similar results that validated previous findings.

Overall, I had a surprisingly positive EE experience that equipped me with foundational research skills and allowed me to experience all steps of a project, from conceptualisation, literature review, experimental design, and analysis, that has increased my confidence and prepared me for future endeavours.
