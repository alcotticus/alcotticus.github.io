Summary
------
White bread is one of my favourite things to bake; not only is it easy to prepare, it is also very versatile as a basic component for any meal. One thing I noticed, however, was how varied the crust looked in colour every time I prepared a batch with different substitutions; I soon discovered the golden-brown hue of bread crust was a result of the Maillard reaction. Although the Maillard reaction is responsible for the umami taste in certain food products, it may also produce harmful advanced glycation endproducts, leading to an increased necessity for an understanding of the determinants of this reaction's extent of completion. Melanoidins, which are also produced in this reaction, enabling the usage of UV-vis spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of endproducts, and therefore progress of reaction.
