Summary
------
Snowboarding has always been a passion of mine. I was particularly fascinated with big air, which was just introduced as an Olympic event in 2018, in which competitors ride down a large ramp and perform a single aerial trick, scored according to its difficulty, execution, amplitude, and landing. As the culmination of snowboardersâ€™ ever-growing interest in landing increasingly challenging tricks, the quadruple cork 1800, consisting of five rotations and four flips, has emerged as one of the most physically demanding feats performed yet, with only a few recorded successful attempts after the first performed by Billy Morgan in 2015. In this project, I evaluate the values of key launch parameters (linear velocity and angular momentum) necessary for a safe landing on an Olympic ramp, comparing these with Morgan's actual launch parameters.
