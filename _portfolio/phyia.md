Summary
------
As an avid volleyball player, I was all too keen to embark on a related physics project. My experience as a player led me to consider how the internal air pressure of volleyballs affects gameplay; how might players adjust their technique to accommodate a more or less inflated ball, especially if they are not able to change the air pressure itself, as in the case in many competitions? Although the research question appeared simple at first glance, it was a fun challenge to derive a relationship from fundamental principles that allowed me to hypothesise an equation that was more theoretically sound yet similar in shape to the assumed logarithmic graph as obtained from previous empirical observation.
