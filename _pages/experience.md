## June 2024: Internship at Defence Science and Technology Agency (Air Systems)

Over the summer of 2024, I interned at DSTA under the Air Systems department, where I was attached to a project on satellite tracking in a local context, and i was involved in working on a web-based interface for the application. Despite having a foundation in Python, I had never done web development before and was intimidated by having to pick up HTML and some Javascript in a short period of time. Eventually, though, I realised that I actually preferred the project-based approach of learning. Picking up skills, I found, was much more intuitive with a deliverable, since I could gradually accumulate a repertoire of knowledge and understand theory in relation to its applications in the context of actual projects.

One aspect of the internship experience I particularly enjoyed was the opportunity to work alongside other interns, most of whom were more experienced than myself and pursuing studies in a variety of different fields from computer science to various disciplines of engineering. Not only did this give me the opportunity to collaborate and seek guidance from seniors with more expertise, it also allowed me to learn about and gain exposure to a range of new topics, which I found particularly enriching.

## Oct - Dec 2022: Internship at A*STAR IHPC, Electronics and Photonics Department
After the completion of my 2022 end-of-year examinations, I completed a student attachment at A*STAR's Institute of High-Performance Computing (IHPC) to work on the simulation of electronic and photonic components, specifically avalanche photodiodes. Despite having little experience in this field, I had the chance to devote many hours into the reading and collation of literature to bring myself up to date with relevant background knowledge on silicon photonics and electrodynamics. First, I completed courses on and developed my proficiency with the Ansys Lumerical optical and electrical simulation software, Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and CHARGE solvers respectively.

Next, I experimented with the methodology and trade-offs associated with converting 2-dimensional simulations into their 3-dimensional counterparts, as well as attempting to get a more accurate result by using a finer mesh with a smaller maximum step size. Both of these processes face restraints regarding memory and time requirements. This led me to the discovery of how researchers mitigate these issues by taking advantage of properties such as the symmetry of the avalanche photodiode, which would thus enable the simulation of just half of the object, noticeably reducing memory and time requirements.

Afterward, I repeated the process to obtain results on the efficiency of single-photon avalanche diodes, as demonstrated by existing literature, to experience the way researchers conduct parameter sweeps to analyse the efficiency for varying waveguide widths and corresponding photodiode widths, which finally contributes to the optimisation of avalanche photodiode geometry and design.
